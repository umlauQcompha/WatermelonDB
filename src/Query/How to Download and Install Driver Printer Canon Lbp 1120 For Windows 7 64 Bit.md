## Step 1: Visit the Canon website
 
The first step is to visit the official Canon website and find the support page for your printer model. You can use this link[^1^] to access the support page for the Laser Shot LBP-1120 printer. Alternatively, you can also use this link[^2^] or this link[^3^] to find other sources of drivers and manuals for your printer.
 
## Step 2: Select your operating system
 
The next step is to select your operating system from the drop-down menu on the support page. Since you are using Windows 7 64 bit, you need to choose "Windows" as your operating system and then select "Windows 7 (x64)" as your OS version. This will filter the available drivers and software for your printer according to your operating system.
 
## Step 3: Download the driver file
 
The third step is to download the driver file that matches your printer and operating system. You can choose from different types of drivers, such as PPD, Generic Plus PCL6, Generic Plus PS3, or Generic Plus UFR II. Each driver has its own features and compatibility with different applications. You can read the description of each driver before downloading it to make sure it suits your needs. To download a driver file, click on its name and then click on "Download". You will be asked to agree to the terms and conditions before proceeding with the download. Save the file in a folder on your computer where you can easily find it later.
 
## Step 4: Decompress the driver file
 
The fourth step is to decompress or unzip the driver file that you have downloaded. The driver file is usually compressed in a ZIP or RAR format to reduce its size and make it easier to download. To decompress the file, you need a software that can extract ZIP or RAR files, such as WinZip, WinRAR, or 7-Zip. Right-click on the driver file and choose "Extract All" or "Extract Here" depending on your software. This will create a new folder with the same name as the driver file that contains the extracted files.
 
## Step 5: Install the driver
 
The final step is to install the driver on your computer. To do this, open the folder that contains the extracted files and look for a file named "Setup.exe", "Install.exe", or something similar. Double-click on this file and follow the instructions on the screen to complete the installation process. You may need to restart your computer after installing the driver for it to take effect.
